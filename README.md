# Herman-Blink
Herman-Blink is a web-based application that converts blinks to text

It was developed to assist my friend, Herman Yunos who was paralysed after undergoing surgery and was only able to communicate with blinking his eyes. However I didn't manage to complete it fast enough for him to make use of it. May he rest in peace. Do make a prayer for him if you come across this, he was a good man. May this bring benefit to someone else whom might need it.

Thanks to https://github.com/CallMeSwal/BlinkToText for the initial inspiration on using OpenCV and many other sources of OpenCV.js tutorials to get this done. It is still far from complete.

TODO/Wishlist:
- Faster selection of text
- Autocomplete of text
- Detection of spectacles (Doesn't work well with spectacles on)
- To work in dim light
- Not tested on people with smaller eyes (Doesn't work well when eyes are not fully opened)
- Save text
- Send message across SMS/Email etc.
- And more..
